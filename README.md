ElderSafe is a wearable IoT device designed to enhance elderly safety and health monitoring through real-time fall detection and step tracking.
Built with an ESP32 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor module, the system uses motion data to detect falls and count steps accurately. In the event of a fall, the device sends instant alerts to caregivers via the Blynk mobile app. To ensure long-term usability, it also features low-power operation through deep sleep mode, allowing up to 72 hours of continuous use.
ElderSafe is compact enough to be carried in a pocket and is protected by a shock-resistant casing, making it ideal for daily use in real-world environments.
